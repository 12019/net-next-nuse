Library operating system (libos) version of Linux
=================================================

* Overview

New hardware independent architecture 'arch/lib', configured by
CONFIG_LIB gives you two features.

- network stack in userspace (NUSE)
- network simulator integration, which is called Direct Code Execution
  (DCE)
(- more abstracted implementation of underlying platform will be a future
   direction (e.g., rump hypercall))

In both features, Linux kernel network stack is running on top of
userspace application with a linked or dynamically loaded library.

They have their own, isolated network stack from host operating system
so they are configured different IP addresses as other virtualization
methods do.


* How different with others ?

- User-mode Linux (UML)

UML is a way to execute Linux kernel code as a userspace
application. It is completely isolated from host kernel but can host
arbitrary userspace applications on top of UML.

- name space

Container technologies with namespace brings a process-level isolation
to host multiple network entities but shares the kernel among
processes, which prevents to introduce new features implemented in
kernel space.


* Build

configuration of arch/lib follows a standard configuration of kernel.

 make defconfig ARCH=lib

or

 make menuconfig ARCH=lib

then you can build a set of libraries for libos.

 make library ARCH=lib


* Hello world

you may first need to configure a configuration file, named
'nuse.conf' so that the library version of network stack can know what
kind of IP configuration should be used. There is an example file
at arch/lib/nuse.conf.sample: you may copy and modify it for your purpose.

 sudo NUSECONF=nuse.conf ./nuse ping www.google.com


* Features
- per-userspace application network stack
- netmap support
- intel dpdk support


* Example use cases
- regression test with Direct Code Execution (DCE)

'make test' by DCE gives a test platform for networking code, with the help
of network simulator facilities like link delay/bandwidth/drop configurations,
large network topology with userspace routing protocol daemons, etc.

An interesting feature is the determinism of any test executions. A test script
always gives same results in every execution if there is no modification on test
target code.

For the first step, you need to obtain network simulator environment. 'make testbin'
does all the stuff for the preparation.

% make testbin -C tools/testing/libos

Then, you can 'make test' for your code.

% make test ARCH=lib

 PASS: TestSuite netlink-socket
 PASS: TestSuite process-manager
 PASS: TestSuite dce-cradle
 PASS: TestSuite dce-mptcp
 PASS: TestSuite dce-umip
 PASS: TestSuite dce-quagga
 PASS: Example dce-tcp-simple
 PASS: Example dce-udp-simple


- userspace network stack (NUSE)

an application can use its own network stack, distinct from host network stack
in order to personalize any network feature to the application specific one.
The 'nuse' wrapper script, based on LD_PRELOAD technique, carefully replace
socket API and redirect system calls to the network stack library, provided by
this framework.

files sim*.[c] indicate to relate to simulator via Direct Code
Execution (DCE), files nuse*.[ch] indicate to relate to Network Stack
in Userspace (NUSE). other files are shared functions between them.
